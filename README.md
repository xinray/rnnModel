# RNN_Text_Classify

This code belongs to the ["implement a RNN for text classification in Tensorflow"](http://blog.csdn.net/u010223750/article/details/53334313) POST






#Requirements

Python 2.7

Tensorflow > 0.11

Numpy







#Training
train_rnn_classify.py

#note
this code save the model checkpoints and save the summary at given epoch, these actions will slow down the training speed,so if you want to do a quick job, just remove these codes if you need
